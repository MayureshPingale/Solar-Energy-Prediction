# Solar-Energy-Prediction


Solar Energy systems are an important source of renewable energy generation. Solar intensity is directly proportional to solar power generation and solar power generation is highly dependent on weather fluctuations. The machine learning and deep learning model is used that predicts the amounts of solar power generation using weather data.
